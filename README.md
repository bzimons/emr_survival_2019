# Modelo de regressão Kumaraswamy-Weibull com fração de cura

This was a paper presented in the Escola Modelos de Regressão (2019), as I was a grad student.

## Abstract:

An important area of Statistics is Survival Analysis, which aims to analyze times until the occurrence of a certain event, and sometimes with censorship.  This work consists on the development of a regression model based on the Kumaraswamy distribution. Due to the the fact that Weibull is a distribution with many applications in this area of study, we used the Weibull function to compose the Kumaraswamy-Weibull distribution function. Furthermore, the concept of cure fraction was used, that mean, it occurs when it is assumed that part of the population was cured during the study.
